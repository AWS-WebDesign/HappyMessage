    <p>Welcome to Sasha's 2019-2020 Web Design portfolio! Arranged in
    chronological order, below are all the webpage projects she's created in the
    past semester. Click on the images to explore the webpages. At the bottom of
    each website's hompage, there is an orange home icon to take you back to this
    main portfolio site.</p>

        <h3>Recurring Dream</h3>
        <p>My first webpage! The recurring dream was the first project I did this year.
        While its content is quite rudimentary, it shows the progress of my knowledge
        and skills surrounding web design. With this project, I learned basic HTML structure,
        how to push files to GitHub, and header/paragraph elements. The css style present
        was added later when I was practicing using css styles.</p>

        <h3>Animal Wiki Page: The Iguana</h3>

        <p>The task for this project was to create a webpage that includes a small
        biography on an animal. I practiced using divs and style elements to create
        blocks of text with different colors, paddings, margins, etc. Later on when
        we started learning about css, I also link this page to a css file for font
        and other background colors.</p>

        <h3>Environmental Call to Action: Deforestation</h3>
        <p>This project asked each of us to make a webpage describing an environmental issue.
          In the process, we learned how to imbed images and videos into our webpages. I also
          learned how to use the anchor element and href attribute to add external links for citations.</p>

        <h3>Collector's Guide: The Art of Collection</h3>
        <p>This partner project asked us to make a system of webpages that were
        internally linked and could be easily navigated through. My partner,
        Ananya, and I made a webpage showcasing her music collection. The homepage
        links to subcategories including solo artists and bands, and those pages lead
        to the individual pages for each album. We also learned how to make tables,
        and used this to display some statistics about each album.</p>

        <h3>Fall Guide to the Pacific Northwest</h3>
        <p>For this project, I made a series of webpages that described
          fall activities to do in the PNW. I learned complex css structures
        like navigation bars and image galleries. It also involved a lot of linking internal and
        external links, as well as linking images. Another element I learned was columns and
        overflow options.</p>

        </a>
        <h3>Buzzfeed Quiz</h3>
        <p>For this project, I had to learn how to make forms. I learned about different
        input types, and because we didn't have a server, I used Javascript to display
        the results of my form. This was a bit of a challenge since I had never used
        Javascript before, and I had to take a lot of inputs into consideration. I made
        a form where the user chooses different options to create an ice cream sundae, and
        based of their choices, the form calculates and guesses their age.</p>

        <h3>Digital Ethics: The Digital Divide</h3>
        <p>For this project, we were asked to inform and educate the user about a
         social or ethical issue surrounding the digital age. My partner, Cora, and I
        chose the digital divide. We also learned how to make animations using HTML
        and css and this was one of the criteria for the project. We chose to make
        our animation a graphic of the words digital and divide diverging at the
        top of the page to show a literal divide of the two words.</p>
